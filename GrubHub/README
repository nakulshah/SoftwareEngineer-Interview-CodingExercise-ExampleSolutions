Write a function that identifies the restaurants getting the most orders in each city. The function 'getTopPerformers' should return a list of restaurants, each of which must have a number of orders higher than the average order-count-per-restaurant in the same city. A supporting interface and definition for RestaurantInfo are provided as a starting point. Please submit a solution in either Java, Javascript, or Ruby.

(RestaurantFinder.java)
import java.util.List;

public interface RestaurantFinder {
public List getTopPerformers(List restaurants);
}


(RestaurantInfo.java)
public class RestaurantInfo {
private int restaurantId;
private int orderCount;
private int cityId;

public RestaurantInfo(int restaurantId, int orderCount, int cityId) {
this.restaurantId = restaurantId;
this.orderCount = orderCount;
this.cityId = cityId;
}
public int getRestaurantId() {
return restaurantId;
}
public int getOrderCount() {
return orderCount;
}
public int getCityId() {
return cityId;
}
}

For example, given the following inputs:
RestaurantInfo(1, 100, 1)
RestaurantInfo(2, 200, 1)
RestaurantInfo(3, 100, 1)
RestaurantInfo(4, 400, 2)
RestaurantInfo(5, 200, 2)
RestaurantInfo(6, 400, 2)
The getTopPerformers should return RestaurantInfo objects for restaurant ID's 2, 4, and 6. Restaurant 2 has more orders than the average in city 1 (133.3), restaurants 4&6 have more orders than the average in city 2 (333.3).
