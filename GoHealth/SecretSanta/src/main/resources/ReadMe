Q] Which problem does this software solve?
A] This software can solve the Secret Santa Assignment Problem

Q] Check List
A] The code must be compilable and produce the correct output. = Check
   Unit tests are not required. = Check
   Include any build scripts, dependency management configuration files, etc. = pom.xml = Check
   Package everything as a complete project. Compress the package into one file then send it back to the
   GoHealth Technical Recruiter. = zip = Check
   Implement at least 2 algorithms/implementations. = Check
   Use your judgement on how to design it. = Currently there are two separate test 
        classes and implementation classes. Using Spring Dependency Injection could
        have decreased the lines of code, but to keep things simple, it was not used
        If you need a version with Spring Dependency Injection please let me know
        and I will provide it to you within 60 minutes of notice.

Q] What criteria was used to certify the solution as acceptable?
A] All the tests in com.nakul.shah.secretsantatest SecretSantaHashSetTest & SecretSantaRandomTest must pass
(1) No participant should be assigned a Santa to himself
(2) Every participant should be assigned a santa
(3) Exceptions will be thrown when
    (a) The input set is null or empty
    (b) There are duplicate participants
    (c) Single participant is supplied
    (d) Name of the participant is null or empty
(4) Assigned Santa algorithm must not be merely right/left shifted from participants

Q] This could all be accomplished by a single static function. Why was such a big application written?
A] One Word: Expandability 
Elaborate: It is not just about solving this particular problem. It is about laying the framework for solving many more 
to come.
Example: (1) This framework can be leveraged for White Elephant, etc.

NOTE: Using Spring Dependency Injection could
    have decreased the lines of code, but to keep things simple, it was not used
    If you need a version with Spring Dependency Injection please let me know
    and I will provide it to you within 60 minutes of notice.
